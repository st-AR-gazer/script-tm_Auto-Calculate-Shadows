# Batch Compute (Calculate) Shadows for Trackmania 2020

This executable is made for Trackmania 2020 and is used to automate the process of calculating shadows for a large number of maps. This means you don't have to switch between them to compute shadows—it does this by launching `Trackmania.exe` with some extra instructions.

## Overview

This executable identifies the location of `Trackmania.exe`, or asks you to provide one, and starts up the game with extra parameters to compute shadows for custom maps. This process requires closing any running instances of Trackmania, so make sure to save your progress before running it!

## Prerequisites

* Windows operating system
* [Trackmania](http://trackmania.com/) game installed
* Custom maps created and saved in a folder named `Maps`

## How It Works

Literally just run the script—rest should be pretty self-explanatory. The only thing I should probably mention is that you can also choose `auto`. This automatically finds all your installed Trackmania instances and lets you pick the correct one. I'd *highly* recommend you use the one you primarily use to actually play the game, since this should support all map types.
